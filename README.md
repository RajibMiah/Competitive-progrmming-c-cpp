# My Basic C Programming Repository

This repository contains my solutions to basic programming problems written in C. The code in this repository is intended for beginners who are learning the fundamentals of programming using C.

Contents
The repository contains the following files:

hello_world.c: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
variables.c: A program that demonstrates the use of variables and basic arithmetic operations.
control_flow.c: A program that demonstrates the use of if-else statements, loops, and switch statements.
functions.c: A program that demonstrates the use of functions and function calls.
arrays.c: A program that demonstrates the use of arrays and loops with arrays.
